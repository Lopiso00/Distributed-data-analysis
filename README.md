# Distributed-data-analysis

For this project we wereasked to selct a high-dimensional dataset and perform some interesting analysis on it.
After some online researches we decided to adopt the Zillow dataset, that describes the housing situation in the USA for the year 2016 using 50+ features for almost 3M rows. 
On this data were performed some tasks exploiting a variety of models, like kmeans for clustering, randomforest, linear regression and grandientboosting for regression tasks and some basic techniques for classification on imbalanced data.
